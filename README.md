# TandemPointsSolver
This program is a solver for the game Tandem Points.

The game is defined here:

Game: Tandem Points 

Position:  The board consists of n positive integers on the number line and two stones are used for the game.  
The set of points (usually labeled S and containing 1) is chosen such that the distances between elements in S are distinct.  
Such a set is called a valid game board. 

Players:  The first player is “Alice” and the second is “Bob”. 

Placement of stones:  Alice chooses an integer in S to place the first stone.  
Bob chooses a different integer to place the second stone. 

Moves:  Players alternate choosing one stone to move to another element in S that has not already been chosen.  
The distance between the two stones must decrease.   

Winner:  The player unable to move loses.
